# techdegree-project-2
 My second techdegree project

This is a search project, along with some pagenation. The user will be able to search through the list of students to see the matching results. 


The skills used to complete this process was in creating a search algorithm purely in JS, where it will only search the name of the student. The user will also be able to see their search results as they type them in real time. Pagenation was also used, where the correct number of pages are generated based off of the number of students that are there. The pages will also update based off of the search results. 


I am attempting to go for exceeds: 

- I have a search bar. The search feature will function in real time as it's typed, and will also function when the search button is clicked, or the enter button is pushed. There is also a reset button that will reset the page to it's default view of the full list. 

- The number of pages is adjusted after the search is done, based off of the number of matches. 

- There is a message displayed on the webpage where there are not results to be found.
